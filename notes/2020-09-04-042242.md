### show std::string as string during debugging

https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/201

I could get std::string to show up in the debugger (compiling with clang-5.0 debugging with gdb) when compiling with -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG. See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41745527/cannot-view-stdstring-when-compiled-with-clang

-fno-limit-debug-info will make your debug info larger, slow link (if you're not using -gsplit-dwarf) and debugger performance. But, yes, will address this.

As mentioned previously, the best thing to do is to install the -dbg build of your STL.

(& GCC does the same thing for, say std::ifstream - so it also relies on users having the dbg info for their STL to debug (there are similar flags you can use to disable GCC's debug info size optimizations as well, though))
```

-fno-limit-debug-info èƒ½workout.
