CVC4 https://cvc4.github.io/

- CVC4 is the fourth in the Cooperating Validity Checker family of tools.

- CVC4 works with a version of first-order logic with polymorphic types and has a wide variety of features including:
  - several built-in base theories: rational and integer linear arithmetic, arrays, tuples, records, inductive data types, bit-vectors, strings, finite sets and relations, separation logic, floating point arithmetic, and equality over uninterpreted function symbols
  - support for quantifiers
  - an interactive text-based interface
  - a rich C++ API for embedding in other systems
  - model generation abilities
