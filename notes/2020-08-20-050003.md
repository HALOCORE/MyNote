steps:

- define the remote interface
- implement the server
- implement the client
- compile the source files
- start the Java RMI registry, server, and client

A Java RMI registry is a simplified name service that allows clients to get a reference (a stub) to a remote object. In general, **a registry is used (if at all) only to locate the first remote object a client needs to use**. Then, typically, that first object would in turn provide application-specific support for finding other objects. For example, the reference can be obtained as a parameter to, or a return value from, another remote method call. For a discussion on how this works, please take a look at [*Applying the Factory Pattern to Java RMI*](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/Factory.html).
