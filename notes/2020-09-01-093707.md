## 【JLP99】Inductive Synthesis of Recursive Logic Programs: Achievements and Prospects 

> JLP / 1999
>
> inductive inference / inductive logic programming / recursion / schemas

The inductive synthesis of recursive logic programs from incomplete information such as I/O examples, is a challenging subfield both of **ILP (Inductive Logic Programming)** and of the synthesis (in general) of logic programs from formal specifications.

We first overview ... focusing on the techniques specifically for the **inductive synthesis of recursive logic programs**, also discussing a few **general ILP techniques that can also induce non-recursive hypotheses**. Then we analyse the prospects of these techniques.

结论：

- about inductive synthesis of recursive (logic) programs:
- challenging的原因：recursive programs are particularly delicate mathematical objects that must be designed with utmost care
- 为什么重要：recursive programs (for certain predicates) are sometimes the only way to complete the induction of a finite hypothesis (involving these predicates).
- reliability和speed进展缓慢，required inputs正在下降，不同的方法数目巨大。
- 讨论了可能应用：knowledge discovery and software engineering (or rather: program-mining)
- 不同的应用需要completely different settings，这些不同点应该在将来的技术中充分考虑。

## 【JofML06】 Inductive Synthesis of Functional Programs: An Explanation Based Generalization Approach

> Journal of Machine Learning Research / 2006
>
> inductive program synthesis / inductive functional programming / explanation based generalization / recursive program schemes

an approach to the inductive synthesis of recursive equations from I/O examples. 基于函数式Lisp的经典two-step approach:

- 第一阶段：IO examples根据一个datatype theory重写为traces，解释outputs如何从inputs产生；这些traces能被集成进一个conditional expression，表示一个non-recursive program。
- 第二阶段：初始的program term被generalized into recursive equations，通过搜索term中的syntax模式。

本文工作拓展了这一classical work：

- 能够在一个synthesizing step内induce到一组recursive equations
- equations能够包含超过一个recursive call
- 额外需要的参数会被自动引入

Conclusion:

- 一种EBG approach，从IO examples中inducing能够表示函数式程序的sets of recursive equations
- 还没做的：knowledge about further datatypes such as trees and natural numbers，超过一个参数，使用用户定义或之前得到的functions
- 限制：restriction to structural problems，因为计算traces是deterministically而不是搜索。列表排序就无法做。

Synthesis from examples involves addressing two key technical challenges:

- design of a UI model to deal with the **ambiguity** 
- design of an search algorithm:
  - based on SAT/SMT solvers (formal methods community), 
  - version space algebras (machine learning community), 
  - and A\*-style goal-directed heuristics (AI community).

本文介绍一些有效的UI model和算法（synthesis from examples)，讨论一些应用领域的的synthesizer (bit-vector, spreadsheet, geometry, algebraic identities, repetitive drawings, mathematical terms).

We believe that the most interesting applications of the synthesis technology can be in the areas of **end-user programming**, and **intelligent tutoring systems**. It remains an open research problem to **design intelligent multi-modal interfaces** that can take examples, natural language, speech, touch, etc. as input.

## 【CAV13】Recursive Program Synthesis

> CAV / 2013 / Aws Albarghou, Sumit Gulwani

本文present了ESCHER，一个通用高效的算法，与用户交互IO examples，合成recursive programs。ESCHER is parameterized by the components（program中能够使用的指令）。ESCHER使用了一种novel search strategy利用特殊的数据结构来推理conditionals并合成recursive procedures。经过实验，能够合成整数、列表、树相关程序，且比一个SAT-based synthesizer SKETCH性能要好。

结论：

- technical side，未来可以extend ESCHER来合成loops；为了提升其synthesize constants的能力，可以考虑与SMT-based search结合（check if there is a solution that uses synthesized constants within n steps for a given input-output example）
- application side，applicability of ESCHER as an intelligent tutoring system

## 【PLDI14】Test-Driven Synthesis

> PLDI / 2014 / Sumit Gulwani

提出一个program synthesizer which can be parameterized by an arbitrary DSL that may contain conditionals and loops and therefore is able to synthesize programs in any domain. 用户提供一列越来越复杂的IO examples，以及expert-written DSL definition。展示了一些应用（字符串，XML，table的变换）。

First, we developed a novel iterative synthesis technique inspired by test-driven development，IO examples一次读取一个，随着程序is refined。

Second, the DSL allows our system to take an efficient component-based approach to enumerating possible programs.

结论：

advances the state-of-the-art in component based synthesis which has been **restricted to synthesis of straight line code fragments** over a given set of components. 实的能够包含conditionals和loops。未来工作准备研究function inverses in the DSL(似乎就是FlashMeta)，扩展control flow structures.

presents an algorithm for synthesizing **recursive functions that process algebraic datatypes.** exploit both **type information** and **I/O examples** to prune the search space. uses **refinement trees**, a data structure that succinctly represents constraints on the shape of generated code.

相关工作和结论：

- **Proof- and Type-theoretic Synthesis**
  - At its core, λsyn is a proof theory-inspired synthesis algorithm, not the first to **apply proof theory for program synthesis**. Some of the earliest program synthesis work was rooted in **resolution-based theorem proving, using axiomatic specifications** (Green 1969) or **even input–output examples** (Summers 1976). Recent systems explored enumerative, rather than deductive approaches. MagicHaskeller [2012] **enumerates programs using a set of logical rules** and permitted components, caching them for later lookup. It is fast, but **does not generate programs that branch**. Igor2 (Kitzelmann 2010) attempt to combine the best of the **deductive and enumerative** worlds.
  - take advantage of the specifications that types provide. **InSynth** is particularly noteworthy because it also adapts the **type inhabitation problem for synthesis**. InSynth performs a backwards-style proof search similar to MYTH, But no IO examples.
- **Functional-Recursive Program Synthesis**
  - Most notable are Escher (Albarghouthi et al. 2013) and Leon (Kneuss et al. 2013). MYTH can be thought of as an evolution of Escher. Escher builds terms from the bottom-up whereas **MYTH builds terms top-down**.
  - Leon focuses on properties, rather than concrete examples, discharged via **counterexample guided inductive synthesis** (CEGIS) (Solar-Lezama 2008) and
    a SMT solver (Barrett et al. 2008).
  - a solver-based approach is largely orthogonal to our type-directed synthesis procedure. Solver-based algorithms generally **bubble up constraints until they can be collected** and discharged globally.
- Conclusion
  - λsyn combines foundational techniques from proof theory with ideas from modern example-driven program synthesis. prototype, MYTH, show that type-directed program synthesis is a viable approach to synthesis that takes advantage of the rich structure present in typed, functional programming languages.

## 【TACAS17】Scaling Enumerative Program Synthesis via Divide and Conquer

> TACAS / 2017

the Syntax- Guided Synthesis (SyGuS) problem is to find an expression that satisfies
both the syntactic and semantic constraints: **semantic constraint** specified by a logical formula, a **syntactic constraint** specified by a context-free grammar.

An **enumerative approach** to solve this problem is to **systematically generate all expressions from the syntactic space** with some **pruning**. performs well on small to medium sized benchmarks.

Our approach: a **divide-and-conquer** approach by **separately enumerating** (a) smaller expressions that are **correct on subsets** of inputs, and (b) predicates that **distinguish these subsets**. expressions and predicates are then combined using decision trees (multi-label decision tree learning problem). We propose a novel technique of associating a probability distribution over the set of labels that a sample can be labeled with. use standard **information-gain based heuristics** to learn compact decision trees.

prototype implementation **eusolver**, placed first in the general track and the programming-by-examples track (2016).

总结:

- Most synthesis algorithms proposed in recent literature can be viewed as an instantiation of CEGIS (counterexample guided inductive synthesis).
- Synthesis of recursive programs and data structure manipulating code has also been studied extensively
  - Recursive Program Synthesis (CAV 2013)
  - Synthesis Modulo Recursive Functions (OOPSLA 2013)
  - Comfusy: A Tool for Complete Functional Synthesis (CAV 2010)
- SyGuS first: Enumerative Search, Stochastic Search, Symbolic Search
- 本文：The algorithm overcomes the shortcomings of a basic enumerative algorithm by using enumeration to only learn small expressions which are correct on subsets of the inputs. These expressions are then used to form a conditional expression using Boolean combinations of enumerated predicates using decision trees.

## 【ICLR17】Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis

Recent years have seen the proposal of a number of neural architectures for the problem of Program Induction. Given a set of input-output examples, these architectures are able to learn mappings that generalize to new test inputs. But: **computationally expensive and hard to train**, **a model has**
**to be trained for each task**, **hard to interpret or verify the correctness of the learnt mapping**.

In this paper, we propose **Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis**. Based on two novel neural modules. The first module, called the **cross correlation I/O network**, given a set of input-output examples, produces a continuous representation of the set of I/O examples. The second module, the **Recursive-**
**Reverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN)**, given the continuous representation of the examples, synthesizes a program by incrementally expanding partial programs.

Demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the rich and complex domain of regular expression based string transformations.

we took a **supervised-learning approach** here, assuming availability of target programs during training.
In some scenarios, we may only have **access to an oracle** that returns the desired output given an input. In this case, **reinforcement learning** is a promising framework for program synthesis.
